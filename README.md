# 🧠 Darwin's Architecture Blog — Featuring `bisslog`

Welcome to the source code for my technical blog, published at  
👉 **[https://darwinhc.github.io](https://darwinhc.github.io)**

This blog documents my journey in building **clean, decoupled and sustainable software**, with a strong focus on:

- ⚙️ Domain-driven design (DDD)
- 🧩 Hexagonal architecture (Ports and Adapters)
- 🐍 Python microservices
- ☁️ Event-driven systems (AWS Lambda, SQS, EventBridge)
- 🤖 AI-assisted development and code migration
- 🚀 My open source framework: [`bisslog`](https://github.com/darwinhc/bisslog-core-py)

## 📌 Featured Project: `bisslog`

`bisslog` is a minimalistic, framework-agnostic library that helps you build microservices where:

- The **business logic is clean and isolated**
- Infrastructure is **pluggable**
- Handlers for **Lambda / HTTP / events** can be generated automatically
- You write once and reuse across Flask, FastAPI, or AWS — without rewriting core logic
