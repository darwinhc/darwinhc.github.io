  <h1>👋 Hi, I'm Darwin</h1>

  <p>I'm a Systems and Computing Engineer, graduated from <strong>National University of Colombia</strong> 🇨🇴.<br>
  I’m passionate about software architecture, clean code, and building tools that empower developers to move fast — without breaking things.</p>

  <p>Welcome to my space where I write about ideas, tools, and architectural patterns that I’ve applied (and battle-tested) in real-world projects.</p>

  <h3><a href="/bisslog/">🔌 Bisslog</a></h3>

  <p><strong>Bisslog</strong> is a clean architecture toolkit for Python microservices — framework-agnostic, declaratively driven, and highly testable.</p>

  <p>It’s built to help you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep your logic decoupled from frameworks and infrastructure.</li>
    <li>Apply Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) with minimal effort.</li>
    <li>Declare behavior and generate boilerplate code automatically.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Thanks for stopping by — and don’t worry, I’m not afraid of commitment… to good architecture.</em></p>
