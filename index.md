# 👋 Hi, I'm Darwin

I'm a Systems and Computing Engineer, graduated from **Universidad Nacional de Colombia** 🇨🇴.  
I’m passionate about software architecture, clean code, and building tools that empower developers to move fast — without breaking things.

Welcome to my space where I write about ideas, tools, and architectural patterns that I’ve applied (and battle-tested) in real-world projects.

## 🛠️ Projects

### [🔌 Bisslog](/bisslog/)

**Bisslog** is a clean architecture toolkit for Python microservices — framework-agnostic, declaratively driven, and highly testable.

It’s built to help you:

- Keep your logic decoupled from frameworks and infrastructure.
- Apply Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) with minimal effort.
- Declare behavior and generate boilerplate code automatically.

_Thanks for stopping by — and don’t worry, I’m not afraid of commitment… to good architecture._
