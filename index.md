title: Darwin Herrera Architecture Blog â€” featuring bisslog
---

# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Darwin

I'm a Systems and Computing Engineer, graduated from **Universidad Nacional de Colombia**, passionate about software architecture, microservices, and building tools that empower developers to move fast â€” without breaking things.

This blog is a space where I share what I'm building, thinking, and refining â€” with a particular focus on clean architecture, domain-driven design, and scalable service ecosystems.

## âœ¨ What youâ€™ll find here

- Deep dives into the **`bisslog`** ecosystem â€” a set of libraries Iâ€™ve built to help developers structure their Python microservices in a clean, decoupled, and testable way.
- Architecture patterns you can actually apply.
- Tips on keeping your services flexible, maintainable, and fun to work on.

## ðŸ”§ About `bisslog`

`bisslog` is more than a library â€” itâ€™s a mindset. I built it to promote:

- Strong separation of concerns (Ports & Adapters / Hexagonal architecture)
- Framework-agnostic logic â€” code that doesnâ€™t depend on Flask, FastAPI, or AWS
- Declarative configuration to reduce boilerplate and speed up delivery
