## ðŸ”§ About `bisslog`

`bisslog` is more than a library â€” itâ€™s a mindset. I built it to promote:

- Strong separation of concerns (Ports & Adapters / Hexagonal architecture)
- Framework-agnostic logic â€” code that doesnâ€™t depend on Flask, FastAPI, or AWS
- Declarative configuration to reduce boilerplate and speed up delivery
