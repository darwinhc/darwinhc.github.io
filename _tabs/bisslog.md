Welcome to **Bisslog**, the home of clean, testable, and framework-agnostic microservices.

Here you'll find a collection of technical articles, real-world use cases, and advanced patterns built with the `bisslog` ecosystem ‚Äî including [`bisslog-core-py`](https://github.com/darwinhc/bisslog-core-py), [`bisslog-flask`](https://github.com/darwinhc/bisslog-flask), [`bisslog-aws-lambda-py`](https://github.com/darwinhc/bisslog-aws-lambda-py), and more.

Whether you're building your first service or refining an architecture at scale, these posts will guide you through:

- Designing hexagonal (port and adapter) architectures
- Building plug-and-play integrations with queues, databases, and file systems
- Leveraging declarative configuration and code generation
- Adapting your domain to HTTP, messaging, and serverless triggers
- Keeping your logic portable, clean, and testable ‚Äî even across frameworks or languages
