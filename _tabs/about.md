# About this Blog

Welcome to **Darwin Herreraâ€™s Architecture Blog â€” featuring [bisslog](https://github.com/darwinhc/bisslog-core-py)**.

This site is a space for sharing thoughts, techniques, and practical examples around **domain-driven design**, **microservices**, and **clean, maintainable software architectures** â€” primarily using **Python**, but applicable across ecosystems.

## What is Bisslog?

**Bisslog** is a lightweight, pluggable architecture library for Python microservices.  
Its core principles are:

- **Clean Separation of Concerns**: Apply the [Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)) pattern.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Use it with Flask, FastAPI, AWS Lambda, etc.
- **Minimal External Dependencies**: Designed for testability and flexibility.
- **AI-Friendly Design**: Since the business logic is isolated and declaratively defined, **translating use cases between languages using AI is simple and feasible**.
